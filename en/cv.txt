This is MY COMPLETE CURRICULUM VITAE (CV) available to you to understand, in detail, some of the steps and choices that I made in my career.

 This CV is not suitable for printing as it is enormous and will use up almost every ink or toner in your printer! Ok, that was a joke  !
 But, please, maybe it would be better for you to read and print my résumé (https://paulojeronimo.com/cv/en/resume.html), if you want to see the information in this CV in a much more condensed, economical in words, and suitable for printing!

  Professional Experience

 Founder at Finisher.Tech

 October 2019 to Present

Finisher.Tech is my technology startup that unites two of my passions: the pursuit of health and wellness through everyday sports and my relentless desire to produce solutions that use cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Data Visualization to make people increasingly motivated and disciplined in their health plans and wellness.

I am developing decentralized applications (DApps) related to Move-To-Earn in my free time and slow steps because I think people will be adopting the technologies related to my projects in the long term. So, at the time, I’m using the knowledge related to the products I’m creating as an educational product to mentor the market on using such technologies.

At the same time I work for my startup in my free time, I work for other companies simultaneously in the same tech area or others.

Paulo Jerônimo Treinamentos Eireli-ME was the name of my own micro company. It was founded in September 1999 with the name ALP Engenharia de Software Ltda. For many years my company lived only attending some specify customers, without a trademark. Therefore, in April 2010, I decided to give it one: Lado Servidor. Using this name, I developed many works involving the creation of custom training to many customers. Also, I gave solutions and did many services associated with Java application servers. Another work was the application development (especially in Java EE, on multiple platforms).

I kept the Lado Servidor’s blog. This blog is available, now, for historical reasons. It does not suffer updates anymore. All the posts created for this blog was written in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-br). Those posts contain various solutions and tutorials for some technologies, especially those addressing the use of Java EE middleware (JBoss EAP, GlassFish, IBM WebSphere, etc). Some friends (including Marcelo Ancelmo and Bruno Borges), also with extensive knowledge in the Java EE world, contributed in adding some posts to Lado Servidor blog.

In April 2014, I decided to not update Lado Servidor blog anymore. That decision was done to give more emphasis in my own name. Therefore, I asked my accountant to change the name to the current that I’m using.

Through my company, I played the following roles:

  • Java Instructor at Oracle.

  • Senior Consultant at Red Hat.

  • JBoss Instructor at Red Hat.

Using the trademark Lado Servidor:

  •  April 2010 → December 2010, at Cabal: I worked in the assembly of an infrastructure based on JBoss AS and the migration / transformation of services written in Java for this new infra. The migration also involved the "mavenization" of several projects, with the use of Maven 3.0 and Nexus, as well as the development of several scripts (Bash/ Python) for the automation of tasks related to the deployment of components in different environments (from development to prodution).

Before the name Lado Servidor:

  •  June 2007 → December 2007, at Red Hat: I was an instructor for RH336 (JBoss for Administrators) four (4) times. Details in "Delivered Courses".

  •  March 2007 → September 2007, at Summa Technologies: I was a technical project leader for Sun Microsystems in the development of the B2B portal for the customer Banco do Brasil.

  •  April 2003 → December 2007, at Argo Navis: I ministered courses and gave presentations in events in partnership with Helder da Rocha (the owner of this company). Details in "Delivered Courses".
