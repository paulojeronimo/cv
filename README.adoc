[WARNING]
====
Do not clone this Git repository because it will be regenerated
every that I push it.
So you won't be able to update a clone you make from that repository
using the `git pull` command.

For now, I decided to evolve my CV in a private Git repository.
Here (in the link:source-code.zip[]) you will only get the last sources
of it.

This code is open source (see the link:LICENSE[]).
